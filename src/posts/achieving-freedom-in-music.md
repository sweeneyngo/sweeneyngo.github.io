I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting things-- with music, that's no exception. In fact, I find myself picking up new genres and artists that grabs my attention. After a few hours, I've already stashed every song, liveshow, and/or low-fidelity recording I can find in their discography.

This was the case for an artist I'm deeply fond of: [Abu-se-ken](https://x.com/kenkoudaiichine) (虻瀬犬), or simply Abuse. Without him, I doubt I would have cemented my mark on Internet history with my most widely-acclaimed cover, [dogdog ft. Rouon Aro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBTejIVwlbE).

However, I was sick of having to deal with the devil; it's unapologetically expensive to buy subscriptions for streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music just to listen to my favorite artists. Even back then, it was common to download music via Limewire or other P2P software, and while it's heavily frowned upon today, some of my favorite artists endorse music-sharing to be accessible + wildly available. Having exposure, whether through official streaming or not, is often the best method to achieve more sales. I mean, just look at TikTok!

Moreover, audiophiles & music fans can unanimously agree that the recommendation systems of Spotify & Apple Music aren't up to users' standards. It suffers through a strange "tunneling" effect, where artists you listen to are merely regurgiated back to your feed, with only a handful of new artists emerging in your Discover tab based on local listens & somewhat adjacent genres.

Nowadays, I've developed a system that completely eliminates all streaming services from my life, relying only on a self-curated playlist, modded third-party applications, P2P software, and more.

It's recommended to note that I'm, by all means, NOT an expert at collecting music, nor am I claiming that my method is the most optimal for finding and sharing music. I'm merely explaining my thought process & workflow, in hopes to help you learn something new you never knew before!

## Finding Your Motive

First, it helps to consider how important achieving freedom means to you.
How often do you listen to music? Are you satisfied with the current pricing of your monthly subscriptions? Maybe you're not aware of alternatives, and are curious of the possibilities.

Factors like the obscurity of your favorite artists, amount of time you spend listening, availability of the music through various end-devices, et cetera, are all important to consider when thinking about this topic.

For me, my breaking point was the lack of awareness to emerging trends & artists, due to the poor recommendations given to me by Spotify. If I continued to stay loyal to that platform, I wouldn't have curated the music taste I have today. Artists like [Patricia Taxxon](https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/), [Jane Remover](https://janeremover.bandcamp.com/), or [xaev](https://xaev.bandcamp.com/) would have never been able to significantly impact my life, and the feeling of not knowing the larger-than-life world of music outside of my own circle was soul-crushing.

It's worth to mention that the method I'm proposing can be considered ethically "questionable", and I recommend to everyone to take every suggestion with caution. I encourage anyone who is skeptical to do their research to understand where their morals align with its legal issues.

However, if you're someone who (1) doesn't have disposable income to spend on monthly subscriptions, (2) an avid supporter of open-source, or (3) prioritize digital freedom over the potential moral implications, then this article may be useful to you.

For those still anxious, I've attached a rating system, ranging from one to three asterisks, based on how morally dubious the solution is.

## Searching Better Alternatives (*)

When considering other alternatives, I first gauge on how widely available music is on that platform. For more popular "radio-friendly" music, this is less of an issue since the publishing label/artist will ensure that their song/LP is available across all platforms.

For more obscure/independent artists, various platforms serve different advantages for them, and I'll be giving a short introduction of each one:

- [Youtube](https://music.youtube.com/): Easily the most accessible platform, stouting a "anyone can create" mentality that paves the way for emerging artists, producers, and mixers alike. I was able to make music through creating covers, and it was thanks to Youtube that I was given an opportunity to build a following. Even if you don't use Youtube Music, the main platform is still amazing in its own right. Don't underestimate its top-notch recommendations & vast network of many genres/artists.

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/): If you've ever want to support local artists, you may have heard of Bandcamp. Despite its reputation as a shopping platform, Bandcamp has a tight catalogue of new artists, trends, and recommendations to check out. Moreover, Bandcamp is transparent when it comes to various file formats (supports FLAC, OGG, WAV natively) and allows you to maintain your own catalog through its own playback service. An underrated feature of Bandcamp is its follower/following social network, which allows you to easily see people's new purchases, reviews, and listens, which is a far better recommendation system on its own. Some artists are even allowing users to listen to full LPs and EPs for free, and there is an option to donate to your favorite artists through Bandcamp-- a feature that's missing in other streaming platforms. However, a common downside is that some artists/labels don't publish their music on Bandcamp, limiting its availability. My recommendation is to limit Bandcamp as a side-option for finding music, since it's most effective for niche and/or new artists.

- [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/): While Soundcloud has a somewhat controversial role in media, it is still undeniably a valuable resource for finding music. Most indie artists had their humble beginnings in Soundcloud, and with its simple barrier of entry, anybody can produce and release music through Soundcloud, diversifying the amount of music you can find. For covers, flips, and/or mixes, Soundcloud is your oyster. Not to mention, Soundcloud's recommendation is strangely effective, being a strong competitor to even Spotify's.

Even though I've reviewed these options separately, I would often use a combination of all three of these in my daily life, handpicking new songs from each one, so don't restrict yourself to only one of these options.

To aid your search for more music, I would recommend considering [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic) for tracking your music & seeing others' listens, [RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/) to see anonymous ratings of all things music, and if you're willing to sift though the cesspool, [4chan's /mu/](https://boards.4chan.org/mu/).

A tool that I found useful when discovering genres was [Music Map](https://www.music-map.com/), which can be worth exploring!

## Migrating to Self-Curation (*)

Let's say for an ideal citizen, they purchase a LP they really enjoy from Bandcamp, and now they have the digital files in WAV to freely listen to. While Spotify & Apple Music allows individuals to listen to music offline through their local library, I would recommend shifting away from these softwares and use open-source alternatives to catalog your music.

A lovely person by the name of Marcika was able to document how they were able to upload their music to a [portable MP3 player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNFgFbQONJg), which is definitely an option for those who are willing to live frugally. The video also goes more in-depth in some alternatives that I won't mention in this article, so it's worth checking out, especially if you're interesting in burning CDs, listening on Mac, or ripping music through other means.

For most people with PCs, I recommend [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/). For full theming support, it's heavily advised to opt for the 32bit version, not the 64bit one. As of the time of this article, I've been an active user of this software for 6-7 months, and I've been utterly amazed by its compatibility & features.

- Built-in tagging support: Have music files you ripped from unofficial sources? Missing album titles, mismatched ordering, and/or wrong information? Simply edit a song or entire albums in foobar, and have it persist indefinitely in your files. It's insane how easy it is to edit your files through this software, when the alternative is to download an obscure third-party software with less options than foobar.
- Direct folder-library UI: Most people will keep their music in a dedicated music folder, which is already provided in most versions of Windows + Linux. foobar, by default, supports the native folder in the OS, and allows you to freely navigate your directory through the application. It supports sorting by album, artist, alphabetically, and by year, and with the display of album art, a local rating system, visualizations, EQ, and smart search, you will find yourself comfortably sifting through your music with ease.
- Custom theming: If you've ever been dissatisfied with the appearance of foobar, it has the freedom to customize the appearance of it, from the layout, colors, and even custom scripts. For myself, I use [Ottodix's Eole theme](https://github.com/Ottodix/Eole-foobar-theme), which elevates the user experience to the next level, and is my top choice for modernizing the software.

To give a little taste, here is a screenshot of my all-time favorite artist, [Porter Robinson's Nurture](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/porter-robinson/nurture/) on foobar2000:

There is something magical about owning your own music, and keeping your space to listen to your music as minimalist as possible. No distractions, no ads, no feeds.

## Acquiring Music via Soulseek (**)

If you'd rather avoid purchasing music, and you want the ability to freely listen to your favorite artists, I don't blame you. I want to introduce a client software available for Windows, Mac, and Linux called [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/node/1).

As mentioned in its [About](https://www.slsknet.org/news/node/680), it's "ad-free, spyware-free" and it's simply a file sharing network with connected peers.

Put it simply, let's say you're looking for a particular EP in produced in 1993, and you couldn't find it through the official sources I mentioned above. 9 times out of 10, someone else may have the files for that EP, and are sharing it publicly through Soulseek. By connecting to this client, you're now able to freely explore the music shared by thousands of avid users. With enough dedication, you'll be able to find not just the full list of songs, but also multiple variants with various file formats.

Is it illegal? Yes, absolutely, since it endorses the sharing of copyrighted music with little to no restrictions on doing so. You can, of course, obfuscate your identity with a VPN, but consider the following:
- You will be among the 0.01% of people in the large majority of people that are actively listening to music. As such, the time commitment and resources necessary to crack down on you is too large for the music industry to care about.
- It's an obscure software, so most people are not even aware of its existence, so you are safely under most organizations' radar.

As for the sharing of music, you will bear responsibility of ensuring you don't download malware or viruses, but considering the nature of the Soulseek community to be outwardly generous & pro-sharing, it is extremely unlikely you will encounter a virus. To be safe, check the file formats of your download (safe: MP3, OGG, WAV, FLAC) and ensure you're not downloading an executable for instance.

Remember to be an active participant if you decide to use Soulseek: always share, never leech. There is no penalty, but keep in mind you can get banned by others if they see you haven't shared any music of your own. Soulseek wouldn't exist without its users after all!

## Acquring Music through yt-dlp (**)

If you are able to find the music through the official sources, but they lack an ability to download it to your local library, there is a solution for this as well.

You may know about online services like Youtube-MP3, but these websites are unreliable, slow, and sometimes can even be more dangerous than you may think.

A better way to download music through official sources will be a command-line interface software called [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). Despite it being known for downloading Youtube videos (e.g. videos, music, films), it has been continuously updated to expand on other websites, such as Twitter/X, Soundcloud, and more. To see a full comprehensive list of supported websites, I recommend visiting [this page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

For installation, follow the instructions listed in their [README](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Personally, I recommend using a package manager if your OS supports this & you're comfortable with it. Otherwise, the binary standalone executable works fine out-of-the-box. It's recommended to download ffmpeg + ffprobe for videos if you'd like to use yt-dlp for that purpose as well.

For all intents and purposes, look into the [official Wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation) if you have any questions on usage, customization, and installation.

Again, keep in mind the legality issues of this option, but if this doesn't bother you, than the vast customization, ease-of-use, and highly availability of the software will serve you immensely well on your music acquistion.

## Acquiring Music through Piracy (***)

It is a little misleading; after all, the above methods of acquiring music is a form of piracy, but they are relatively safe options that don't harbor any risk on the user side.

It's not recommended to do this method, unless you're knowledgable in sailing the seas, and have ways to obfuscate yourself to avoid any danger.

This is more of a last resort for those who can't find the music they're looking for, and want to try exploring other websites dedicated to online piracy. As such, this section will be particularly brief & I encourage anyone who wants to go down this route to do their own research.

It's heavily recommended to use a VPN of sorts, and my best recommendation is to use an official one. A strong contender is [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/), but any VPN of a similar calibre will work fine. We just want to obfuscate our IP when pirating to avoid anyone identifying who we are.

For all things music, and even other resources you may be interested in, a good place to start in [/r/Piracy's Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/music) which comes with the community's own rating on what sources are credible/reliable to minimize risk.

Personally, I've had a comfortable experience with [RuTracker](https://rutracker.org/forum/index.php), and I highly encourage to use a torrenting service rather than direct download since relying on the S/L ratio is a good overall measure.

For torrenting, you'll need a client, so I recommend using [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) rather than the infamous uTorrent, since it's open-source, safe, and allows searching of public/private sites through the application itself. However, the client software, technically, doesn't matter too much.

## Transfering Music to Devices (*)

Once you found a workflow that's comfortable, you may be wondering if there's ways to migrate your files to your devices. For example, most people don't just listen on their PCs, but they also like the availability of the music on their smartphones, tablets, etc.

With Spotify & Apple Music, all music saved by the user is intrinsically stored on an account-basis, but the methods we've mentioned are strictly kept in physical local storage.

The solution is to be able to transfer files through different devices, and establish a "sync" between your devices without relying on accounts + authorization.

For some, this may be a better alternative since you don't have to depend on creating accounts that put you at risk at overreliance on third-party platforms & data breaches, so it's worth keeping in mind.

There are many ways to transfer files, from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/login/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), and even open-source file sharing methods like [Catbox](https://catbox.moe/). Honestly, it's up to your needs which option you choose, since the advantages of each are relatively the same.

Of course, there will be storage limits that's specific to each one, and as such you will have to pay for more storage if you need it, so I'll discuss a software that's worked for me for free: [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

Given two devices, Syncthing is able to establish a working connection between them by connecting to the local server, and allow the user to share a file/folder through the server.

In other words, you can share your Music folder on your PC, connect your iOS/Android device to the Syncthing server, and watch as your files automatically transfer to your device without any difficulty. In Syncthing's own words: "Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it’s transmitted over the internet."

A common pattern you may have notice with these recommendations is that they are not made to exclusively share music. This is true! You can easily extend your learnings with these handpicked array of applications to carry to other important files, documents, or videos you may have lying around.

You can even authenticate your session, close the server whenever, and share multiple folders. I've personally had success using Syncthing to sync my Obsidian vault, images I've taken on my Phone, and videos I've produced. It really is as simple as it sounds, and vastly better than any alternative I've come across. Please give it a try!

## My Workflow

For me, I frequently look through Youtube Music for music, with the occasional visit to Bandcamp + Soundcloud for interesting stuff. I use a combination of yt-dlp + Soulseek once I'm interesting in downloading a particular song/artist, and listen to them at my own leisure through foobar2000.

That's what works for me, and obviously this article is by no means expansive. There is **seriously** a vast world of resources and tools people have made to make the process of finding your music easier. I hope this was a helpful introduction, and I wish you luck in your music journey!
