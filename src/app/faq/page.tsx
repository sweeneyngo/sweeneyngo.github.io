                Q. Sens/DPI? <br />
                A. Sens varies, but 800 DPI. Basically aim for 24.35in/360 (61.85cm/360) usually. <br />

                Q. Any advice on developing an artstyle? <br />
                A. I&apos;m a personal advocate in imitating your heroes. If you are inspired by someone&apos;s art, it&apos;s okay to replicate their style or take parts of their artistic choices. As long as you&apos;re having fun and learning something new, you&apos;ll develop your own consistency. <br />

                Q. Who is ifu & tala? <br />
                A. Simply put, they&apos;re my OCs. <br />
                &quot;ifu&quot; is my spirtual successor as a human/deer hybrid. I&apos;m still in the process of redesigning them, but they are VERY similar to my previous sona. <br />
                &quot;tala&quot; is my other fursona who is wolven/canine, but I consider them as a pseudo-soulmate to ifu, rather than my identity. To be honest, it&apos;s hard to definitively distance myself from &quot;tala&quot; since they both represent my love for Cervidaes & Canines (yin/yang), so I don&apos;t correct anyone for using either. <br />
