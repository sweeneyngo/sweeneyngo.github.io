          Hello! I&apos;m ifu (refer: <Link className={styles.link} href="/aliases">aliases</Link>). <br />
          I <b>create things on the web</b>, explore <b>interactive interfaces</b>, and <b>architect systems</b>. <br />
          I&apos;m currently a software engineer, building products in healthcare & education, from early-stage startups, non-profits, and large companies.
          I dabble in freeform writing and artistic endeavors through this blog. Here, I write about programming, software development, art, music, and digital independence (hope for revision!).
          Enjoying the pursuit of blogging as an exercise of a <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html"><b>Feynmanian approach</b></a> to lifeâ€” acting freely without worrying about the future.

          In previous lives, I went to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where I majored in Computer Science, and a minor of Bioinformatics. My favorite courses were CS181's Automata, CS161's Fundamentals of AI, and CM122's Algorithms in Bioinformatics. <br />
