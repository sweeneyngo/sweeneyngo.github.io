2:T42e,: If you've ever want to support local artists, you may have heard of Bandcamp. Despite its reputation as a shopping platform, Bandcamp has a tight catalogue of new artists, trends, and recommendations to check out. Moreover, Bandcamp is transparent when it comes to various file formats (supports FLAC, OGG, WAV natively) and allows you to maintain your own catalog through its own playback service. An underrated feature of Bandcamp is its follower/following social network, which allows you to easily see people's new purchases, reviews, and listens, which is a far better recommendation system on its own. Some artists are even allowing users to listen to full LPs and EPs for free, and there is an option to donate to your favorite artists through Bandcamp-- a feature that's missing in other streaming platforms. However, a common downside is that some artists/labels don't publish their music on Bandcamp, limiting its availability. My recommendation is to limit Bandcamp as a side-option for finding music, since it's most effective for niche and/or new artists.4:["id","achieving-freedom-in-music","d"]
