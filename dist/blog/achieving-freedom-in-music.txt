3:T423,: If you've ever wanted to support local artists, you may have heard of Bandcamp. Despite its reputation as a shopping platform, Bandcamp has a dense catalog of new artists, trends and recommendations to check out. In addition, Bandcamp is transparent when it comes to different file formats (supports FLAC, OGG, WAV natively) and allows you to maintain your own catalog through its own playback service. An underrated feature of Bandcamp is its follower/following social network, which allows you to easily see people's new purchases, reviews, and listens, which is a much better recommendation system on its own. Some artists even allow users to listen to full LPs and EPs for free, and there's an option to donate to your favorite artists through Bandcamp, a feature missing from other streaming platforms. A common drawback, however, is that some artists/labels don't release their music on Bandcamp, limiting its availability. My recommendation is to limit Bandcamp as a side option for finding music, as it's most effective for niche and/or new artists.6:["id","achieving-freedom-in-music","d"]
